# Narrative Ideas for Computational Workshop Series

Below are several possible settings for the fictitious story that can scaffold your genomics lab computational workshops. Each setting is designed to be engaging, realistic, and suitable for the Problem → Prompt → Code → Debug → Result learning cycle.

---

## 1. The Human Disease Genomics Lab
You are a new graduate student in a genomics lab focused on understanding the genetic basis of a rare human disease. Your PI has tasked you with analyzing new whole-genome sequencing data from patient samples. Each workshop task is framed as a step in this research project, such as downloading reference genomes, processing patient data, and comparing results to public datasets.

---

## 2. The Conservation Genetics Field Team
You join a lab that studies endangered species. The team has just returned from the field with DNA samples from several populations of a threatened frog species. Your job is to process and analyze the sequencing data to assess genetic diversity and inform conservation strategies. Tasks include downloading reference genomes, assembling new genomes, and comparing population statistics.

---

## 3. The Microbiome Research Group
You are part of a group investigating the gut microbiome of different mammals. The lab has collected fecal samples from zoo animals and wants to compare the microbial communities. Workshop tasks involve downloading microbial genomes, running comparative analyses, and visualizing differences between hosts.

---

## 4. The Crop Improvement Initiative
You are a graduate student in a plant genomics lab working to improve crop yields. Your project involves analyzing the genomes of different rice varieties to identify genes associated with drought resistance. Tasks include downloading plant genomes, running workflows to process large datasets, and integrating results with public gene databases.

---

## 5. The Ancient DNA Analysis Team
You join a lab specializing in ancient DNA. The team has sequenced DNA from archaeological bone samples, and your job is to authenticate, process, and compare these genomes to modern populations. Tasks include handling degraded data, running quality checks, and building reproducible workflows.

---

## 6. The Synthetic Biology Startup
You are the computational lead at a startup engineering bacteria to produce biofuels. The company has sequenced several engineered strains, and you need to analyze their genomes for successful modifications. Tasks include managing code in GitHub, running analyses on the compute cluster, and documenting workflows for the team.
