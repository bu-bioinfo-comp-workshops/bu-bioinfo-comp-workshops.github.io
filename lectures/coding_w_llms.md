# Coding with LLMs

---

# LLMs are only matrices

We need tools that interface with them

---

# Chatbots like ChatGPT are designed around human conversations

They were the first "killer apps" for LLMs

---

## Chatbots interact with LLMs *programmatically* by sending inputs and receiving outputs

---

## We as developers can do the same thing in our code and environments 

iow, we can "cut out the middle man" chatbot and use LLMs directly
