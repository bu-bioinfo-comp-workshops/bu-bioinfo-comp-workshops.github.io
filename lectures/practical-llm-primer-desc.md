Understanding and Using Large Language Models: A Practical Primer
================================================================

This seminar provides a practical introduction to large language models
(LLMs), covering their fundamental architecture, training processes, and
practical applications. Attendees will learn how LLMs process text through
tokenization and attention mechanisms, understand the difference between
training and inference, and learn basic prompt engineering techniques. The
session combines technical concepts with practical guidance for optimizing LLM
interactions through context engineering.
