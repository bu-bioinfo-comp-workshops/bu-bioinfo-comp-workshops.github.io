title: Workshop Overview
layout: single
classes: wide
---

The goal of these workshops is to give participants hands on experience with
computational tools and skills required by modern bioinformatics and
computational biology research. The workshops are designed to be interactive and
engaging, with a focus on practical application of the skills covered.

The workshops are organized as a series of realistic use cases that participants
will work through in a hands on manner. The workshops are designed to be self
contained, with each workshop building on the skills learned in the previous
workshop.

LLM usage is central to these workshops. Each workshop follows the **Problem →
Prompt → Code → Debug → Result** cycle:

1. **Problem Statement**: Clear biological/bioinformatics challenge with specific output goal
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Craft effective LLM prompts to generate initial code. 
3. **Code Generation**: Use LLM to create starting solution
4. **Run & Debug**: Execute code, identify errors, return to LLM for fixes
5. **Iterate**: Repeat LLM interaction until achieving target result
6. **Add New Features**: Augment the problem statement to include new features.
7. **Revise/Append**: Revise the problem statement to include new features.
8. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-7 until the workshop is complete.

Our goal is that you should leave the workshops with the ability to use LLMs to
help understand a problem statement, translate it into technical requirements,
generate initial code, debug it, and iterate until a solution is reached.
You should also understand the limitations of LLMs, what they're good for,
and what they're *not* good for.
