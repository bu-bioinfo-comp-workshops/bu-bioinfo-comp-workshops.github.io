# Workshop 3 Background Slides

---

## Workflow Management in Bioinformatics
- Complex analyses require multiple steps and tools
- Manual execution is error-prone and hard to reproduce
- Workflow managers (like Snakemake) automate and document the process

---

## Introduction to Snakemake
- Snakemake uses rules to define how files are created from input data
- Rules specify input, output, scripts, and resources
- Workflows are defined in a Snakefile (Python-like syntax)

---

## Integrating Python and Snakemake
- Python scripts can be called from Snakemake rules
- Parameters and file paths are passed automatically
- Modular code improves reusability and debugging

---

## Running Snakemake on a Compute Cluster
- Snakemake can submit jobs to clusters using qsub or other schedulers
- Cluster profiles and job scripts help manage resources
- Monitor job status and troubleshoot errors

---

## Using LLMs for Workflow Design
- LLMs can help draft rules, debug errors, and suggest improvements
- Effective prompts describe the workflow steps and expected outputs
- Always review and test generated workflows for correctness
