# Workshop 6 Introduction Slides

---

## Reproducibility and Collaboration

- Finalize your ancient DNA analysis for publication and collaboration
- Organize your repository, write documentation, and prepare for sharing
- Use LLMs to help with documentation and reflection

---

## Problem Statement

- Organize your code, workflows, and results for reproducibility
- Write clear documentation and usage instructions
- Prepare your repository for sharing and collaboration
- Reflect on your computational process and lessons learned

---

## Why Reproducibility and Collaboration?

- Ensures your work can be understood, reused, and built upon by others
- Facilitates teamwork and scientific communication
- Required for publication and open science

---

## Workshop Workflow: Problem → Prompt → Code → Debug → Result

- **Problem:** Define the reproducibility and sharing challenge
- **Prompt:** Craft an effective LLM prompt
- **Code:** Organize, document, and prepare your repository
- **Debug:** Review for clarity, completeness, and reproducibility
- **Result:** Share your work and reflect on your process

---

## Getting Started: Example LLM Prompt

```
I need to prepare my ancient DNA analysis repository for publication and collaboration. Please generate a clear README, usage instructions, and a reflection on the computational process and lessons learned.
```
