## Welcome to the Ancient DNA Lab!

- You are a new grad student in a cutting-edge ancient genomics lab.
- Your first mission: Analyze a newly sequenced ancient mitochondrial genome.
- You'll use LLMs to help you solve real bioinformatics problems step by step.

---

## Problem Statement

- Download a small ancient mitochondrial genome dataset from a public database.
- Calculate basic statistics: sequence length and GC content.
- Summarize your findings for your PI.

---

## Why Ancient DNA?

- Provides insights into human history, migrations, and evolution
- Presents unique computational and biological challenges (degradation, contamination)
- Requires careful data handling and reproducible workflows

---

## Workshop Workflow: Problem → Prompt → Code → Debug → Result

- **Problem**: Define the biological/computational question
- **Prompt**: Craft an effective LLM prompt
- **Code**: Generate and run code
- **Debug**: Identify and fix errors
- **Result**: Summarize and interpret findings

## Getting Started: Example LLM Prompt

```
I need to download a small ancient mitochondrial genome FASTA file from a public database. Please generate Python code to download the file, read the sequence, and calculate its length and GC content.
```
