# Workshop 1 LLM Instructions

## Workshop Title
DNA Sequence Quality Assessment

## Intended Audience
Biologists and bioinformaticians with little prior computational experience.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to assess the quality of sequencing data from FASTQ files.
- Learn to use command-line tools and Python/R for basic bioinformatics analysis.
- Interpret sequencing quality metrics and make recommendations.

## LLM Guidance
- Generate code and explanations that are beginner-friendly.
- Use clear, step-by-step instructions for each task.
- Prioritize hands-on, practical exercises.
- Encourage iterative prompt engineering and debugging with the LLM.
- Focus on the Problem → Prompt → Code → Debug → Result cycle.

## Constraints
- All code should be runnable with minimal dependencies (prefer standard libraries or widely used bioinformatics packages).
- Visualizations should be simple and easy to interpret.
