# Workshop 4 Background Slides

---

## Comparative Genomics: Key Concepts
- Comparing genomes reveals similarities and differences across individuals or populations
- Batch analysis enables efficient, large-scale comparisons

---

## Batch Processing with Snakemake
- Snakemake can automate repetitive tasks across many samples
- Use wildcards and config files to generalize rules
- Modular workflows improve reproducibility and scalability

---

## Python for Comparative Analysis
- Loop over files and aggregate results
- Use pandas and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization

---

## Generating Comparative Plots
- Visualizations (bar plots, boxplots) make patterns and differences clear
- Plots can summarize GC content, sequence length, and more

---

## Using LLMs for Batch Analysis
- LLMs can help write loops, batch rules, and plotting code
- Effective prompts describe the batch task and desired outputs
- Always review and test generated code for correctness
