Welcome to the shiny new BU Bioinformatics Computational Workshop series!

These workshops are designed to help you learn computational skills that are
required by modern bioinformatics and computational biology. More specifically,
the workshops are designed to help you learn how to use large language models
(LLMs) *responsibly* as tools to enhance and extend your abilities. The workshops
are centered around a fictitious but realistic story about a genomics lab that
studies ancient human DNA.
